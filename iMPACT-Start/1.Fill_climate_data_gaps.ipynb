    "# Using probability distributions to fill the gaps in our climate data\n",
    "<img src=\"images/prob_distrib_weather.png\" style=\"width: 400px; float:right\"><h>When there are gaps in climate data—due to missing records for certain days, months, or locations—we can use probability distributions to estimate the missing information. Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe how a particular variable, such as temperature or rainfall, is expected to vary based on past observations. By analyzing historical climate data, we can determine the likely patterns and behaviors of these variables.\n",

    "For example, if we have temperature data for several years but lack information for a few specific months, we can use a probability distribution (such as the Normal distribution) to estimate the likely temperature during those missing periods. This approach relies on statistical techniques to create a model that represents how the variable typically behaves, considering factors like seasonality and trends. \n",
